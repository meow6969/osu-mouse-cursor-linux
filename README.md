# osu-mouse-cursor-linux
thing that makes ur cursor not go to ur other displays when urr playing osu so its noit like on the other screen and isnt annoying  
basically the option to keep mouse cursor confined to the osu window does not work when running osu with wine so i made this  
make sure to have raw mouse input on  

# todo
make this work on different monitor setups
